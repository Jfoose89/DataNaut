**Audit trigger on TimeLog
Automatically logs all changes (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) in the TimeLog table.
This allows us to see what was changed, when, and by whom.
It is useful for debugging and audit tracking.

**Timestamp triggers (CreatedAt / UpdatedAt)
When a record is created, CreatedAt is automatically stored.
When a record is modified, UpdatedAt is automatically updated.
This allows us to easily track when data was created or last changed.

**Business logic trigger (ProjectStartDate / ProjectEndDate)
Prevents incorrect date entries, for example if ProjectEndDate is earlier than ProjectStartDate.
This ensures the data stored in the database is always logically valid.
